## Pre-infection cerebral cortex structure predicts murine polymicrobial sepsis outcome

### We use high resolution structural brain MRIs and a murine polymicrobial sepsis LD50 model to demonstrate that pre-infection variability in brain structure can reliably predict infection outcome. Specifically, mice fated to survive exhibited greater cortical volume and thickness compared to those who succumbed. Our work reveals a readily measurable trait that can predict a murine LD50 polymicrobial sepsis outcome

### Methods

To predict a murine LD50 polymicrobial sepsis, we process our MRI images using [DeepBrainIPP](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbinf.2022.865443/full )
